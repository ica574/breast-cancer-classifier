This project explores the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and other architectures for detecting breast cancer using the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) dataset. The devised system will incorporate data preprocessing, model training, and explainability through Grad-CAM heatmaps, with a Django-powered web application for inference. The study evaluates the model's feasibility for clinical integration, indicating the potential difficulties in adopting such systems like class imbalance, and computational constraints. Future work will involve model optimisation, more advanced architecures, and enhanced data augmentation to aid in generalisability, and usability.
