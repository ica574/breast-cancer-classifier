# Breast Cancer Classifier
This project consists of a series of models for classifying breast cancer mammograms as malignant or benign. The models are trained on a subset of the DDSM dataset of mammogram images and their corresponding labels. The models are split into two categories, with a notebook for each category, CNN-based models, and Vision Transformer-based models. The reason for this split is the different libraries required for training, and evaluating the models, that would otherwise conflict with each other. Thus, for each notebook, an appropriate environment is provided in the `environment.yml` file. This may be spun up through the use of a virtual environment manager such as ```conda``` or ```venv```. Once the appropriate virtual environment is configured, the notebook can be run in a Jupyter Notebook server by invoking ```jupyter notebook .```.
