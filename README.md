# Breast Cancer Classifier
This project consists of a series of models for classifying breast cancer mammograms as malignant or benign. The models are trained on a subset of the DDSM dataset of mammogram images and their corresponding labels. The models are split into two categories, with a notebook for each category, CNN-based models, and Vision Transformer-based models. The reason for this split is the different libraries required for training, and evaluating the models, that would otherwise conflict with each other. Thus, for each notebook, an appropriate environment is provided in the `environment.yml` file. The notebooks are pre-run, however, if the user wishes to reproduce the results, they must spin up a virtual environment through ```conda``` or ```venv```. Additionally, they must download the training data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skooch/ddsm-mammography/data) Once the appropriate prerequisites are satisfied, the notebooks can be run by invoking ```jupyter notebook .```.
